Description: A client to simplify fetching predictions from the Koina web 
  service. Koina is a community driven endeavour to make AI models for life 
  science research more accessible. It is a service that tries to reduce the 
  barrier of entry for using machine learning models in life science research 
  by removing the need to set up and maintain the infrastructure required to 
  run ML models. The project is open-source and adheres to FAIR principles.
