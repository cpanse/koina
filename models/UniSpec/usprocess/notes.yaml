  Unispec is a model trained to predict full HCD mass spectra intensities, containing nearly 8000 different ion types in its output space, including
  a, b, y ion series, precursors peaks, immonium ions and other fragmentation, 21 neutral losses, up to 5 isotopes and internal ions. The koina version
  automatically outputs the 200 highest intensities from the prediction, while setting any unfeasible ions (given the sequence, charge and modifications)
  to have -1 intensity.
  
  Peptide sequences are to be submitted as modified sequences, with modifications immediately following the 1-letter AA where they are located.
  Modifications are represented with the word UNIMOD followed by a colon and the modification's unimod integer, e.g. AGM[UNIMOD:35]MGAK. The
  model was trained for 7 modifications, listed below ith their unimod integers
  
  1 'Acetyl'
  4 'Carbamidomethyl'
  28 'Gln->pyro-Glu'
  27 'Glu->pyro-Glu'
  35 'Oxidation'
  21 'Phospho'
  26 'Pyro-carbamidomethyl'

  The maximum length for peptides can be up to 40 amino acids, and a maximum charge of 8.

  The actual pytorch model was trained on collision energy data in units of eV. The koina version is set up for the user to submit collision energy in NCE 
  and the instrument type (QE for q_exactive, LUMOS for Lumos), and internally will convert this NCE value to its corresponding eV value.
